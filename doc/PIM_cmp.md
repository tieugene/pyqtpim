- ToDo only
- User defined CalDAV server

## By one

### Want:
- Max RFC-5545 support:
  - Fileds: Status (4), Prio (4), Class (4), URL, Attach, Contact, Comment
  - DTStatart/Due: date/datetime
  - Subtasks/Linked
- Off-line
- Sync w/ self-hosted CalDAV (e.g. Radicale)
- List on/off (show/hide)
- Multisort (sort on multiple columns)
- Filters: ...
- Description: plain/md/html

### [RTM](https://www.rememberthemilk.com)
- &odot; RAM=200MB (Linux)
- &odot; Subtasks (Pro)
- &ominus; $40/y
- &ominus; Off-line - Pro only
- &ominus; ~~Self WebDAV~~
- &ominus; Attaches: GDrive/Dropbox/MyComp (Pro)
- &ominus; ~~Multifilter~~ (e.g. Today & List1 & Cat1)
- &ominus; ~~List on/off~~
- &ominus; Status: Active/Done (maybe 'in progress')
- &ominus; Touch-oriented UI

### Lightning
- &ominus; DTStart/Due - datetime only
- &ominus; ~~Filters~~ (work strange)
- &ominus; Prio: `Normal` looks like `None`
- &ominus; Fields: URL (r/o), ~~Comments~~, ~~Contact~~
- &ominus; Permanent buggy
- &ominus; ~~Multisort~~
- &ominus; Cancelled are active

Why not: ~~Filter~~, ~~Multisort~~, Due, ~~URL~~
